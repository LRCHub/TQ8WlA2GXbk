I'm a pretender
Yeah, I'm just a pretender
I stay up on the fashion
I just want that attention

You think that I'm friendly
I just hate feeling tension
I'm just tryna be smashin'
But it don't even matter

Cause I'm a pretender
Yeah, I'm just a pretender
I stay up on the fashion
I just want that attention

You think that I'm friendly
I just hate feeling tension
I'm just tryna be smashin'
But it don't even matter

Saying that I love you just to get with you
Acting like I got my shit together
Acting like I miss you 'cause I'm lonely
It ain't about you, that's just my own shit
Fake a smile, get me through the weekend
No one really knowin' what I'm feeling
Smoke a bowl and I don't even like it
Keep 'em comfortable and stay invited

Touching myself 'til you touch me
Can't love myself 'til you love me
Ain't no one fuck with the real me
You feel me?

I'm a pretender
Yeah, I'm just a pretender
I stay up on the fashion
I just want that attention
You think that I'm friendly
I just hate feeling tension
I'm just tryna be smashin'
But it don't even matter

Chill at home, pretend I had the best night
Bailed on people I still wanna invite
Telling both my friends I'm with the other
Shit don't make no sense, why do I bother?
Cause I'm a pretender
Yeah, I'm just a pretender
I stay up on the fashion
I just want that attention
You think that I'm friendly
I just hate feeling tension
I'm just tryna be smashin'
But it don't even matter
Cause I'm a pretender
