[00:54.46] Remember us
[00:57.44] Shedding weight to hear your name
[01:04.01] Playing games, waiting for the day you claim
[01:26.01] 
[01:14.87] Carolina my love, I'm alive
[01:30.31] Carolina your name, the same as mine
[01:48.31] 
[01:47.12] Hear your voice, hear you walking on the floor
[01:57.34] Always pass. Never stopping at the door
[02:08.14] Carolina my love, I'm alive
[02:18.81] Carolina my love, I don't mind
